# Super Store Sales Dashboard

Welcome to the **Super Store Sales Dashboard** project! This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance across various countries and regions, giving insights into revenue, profits, and customer trends for different years. Built using **Power BI**, it effectively visualizes data from the **Super Store Sales dataset** to allow for easy tracking of key business metrics.

## Key Features of the Dashboard:

### 1. **Total Customers, Countries, Revenue, and Profit**
   - At the top of the dashboard, youâ€™ll find the overall **Total Customers**, **Countries** represented, **Total Revenue**, and **Total Profit** for the selected year. These high-level KPIs allow for a quick snapshot of the store's performance in any given year.

### 2. **Top Countries by Sales and Profits**
   - Two bar charts provide insight into the top-performing countries:
     - **Top Countries by Sales** shows which countries contribute the most to overall sales.
     - **Top Countries by Profits** highlights countries that are driving the highest profits.
   - This helps identify the most valuable markets for the business.

### 3. **Month-wise Sales and Profits**
   - A pair of line charts display the **Month-wise Sales** and **Month-wise Profits** over the course of a year. This visual representation allows for an easy understanding of sales and profit trends, revealing peak months for sales or profitability.

### 4. **Countries with Losses**
   - This table lists the countries that experienced losses, along with their **Sum of Sales** and **Sum of Profit**. The red highlighting makes it easy to quickly spot countries where performance can be improved.

### 5. **Profit by Region**
   - A doughnut chart visualizes **Profit by Region**, breaking down how different regions are contributing to overall profitability. This is useful for understanding how regions compare and which areas are the strongest or weakest in terms of profit generation.

### 6. **Year Selection**
   - A dropdown feature allows users to select different years (e.g., 2011, 2012) to view and compare sales and profit performance year-over-year.
